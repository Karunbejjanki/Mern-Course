The problem with delayedGreeter function, producing Hello, undefined!, is due to using var for the loop variable. Because var is function scoped and not block scoped, the same value of i is shared across all callbacks when they execute later, after timeouts run, time which it has ultimately advanced to its last value, hence when referring to the name it is not defined. Meaning, using let instead guarantees new scope for every turn retaining the accurate index.
