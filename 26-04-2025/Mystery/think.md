The code contains the variable mysteryVariable logging, before and after its initialization, just to show hoisting of JavaScript. Variable declarations by var are hoisted up on top but not their assignment. So, the first console.log() displays the 'undefined' state, and post-assignment shows 10. In the function revealMystery(), the variable mysteryVariable gets hoisted again and is now undefined and shortly thereafter becomes 20 by assignment. As var is function scoped, this inner value does not affect the outer variable that keeps 10.
