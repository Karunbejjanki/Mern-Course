The setupCounter() function initializes itself with an initialValue and increments and decrements method. It returns these operations, allowing to assign the variable for accessing the counter. Each call to setupCounter() creates a new count variable for counterOne and counterTwo because within their closures. The closures keep their own state, so each one has its own independent value with respect to the counter.
